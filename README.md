# Coursera SQL Project: Analyze Data in a Model Car Database
## Mint Classics Company 

This project is part of my journey to enhance my data analytics skills through Coursera. It is a hands-on SQL-based project where I analyze inventory data for the fictional Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic cars and vehicles. The goal is to support inventory-related business decisions, focusing on stock optimization and the closure of a storage facility.

## Work Process

### Step 1: Database Setup

The first step was to download the [`mintclassicsDB.sql`](./mintclassicsDB.sql) file, which contains the script for creating and populating the Mint Classics relational database. Using the **"Import from Self-Contained File"** option in MySQL Workbench, I imported the script, which created a nine-table relational database.

Hereâ€™s a screenshot illustrating the import process:
